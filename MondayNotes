Continuous Delivery with Containers
    - Continuous delivery can help with container fires (bad code into containers)
    - Books: new book: Continuous delivery in java, old book: containerizing contunouos delivery in java
    - java container scope: container image becomes the build pipeline "single binary"
    - adding metadada to containers images is vital
    - must validate container constraints on system quality attributes

    - make dev environment like dev
        - build and test containers locally
    - use identical base images (os and such)

Getting Started with Kafka
    - Kafka is a transaction log
    - 3 guarantees, 
        - producer and consumer are separated
        - as long as there are n-1 replicas available, kafka will receive and push the message
    - zookeeper resoinsibilities
        - elect a cluster leader
        -  keeps an inventory of all the available brokers
        - maintains the list of all topic configurations
    - broker (kafka server)
        - this is where the topics reside
        - topics are kept on a broker
    - topics    
        - logical classification of messages
        - logical separation of messages
    - producer  
        - creates the message
    - consumer 
        - consumes the message
