Effective Unit Testing
    - Definition of test: Verify that a known fixed input, generates a known fixed output
    - Test the middle of the road case, before the edge cases
    - for fuzzy input, fake it output
    - Don't test with random data, use clear fixed data
    - try to not access the network and preferably not the file system
