Effective Unit Testing
    - Definition of test: Verify that a known fixed input, generates a known fixed output
    - Test the middle of the road case, before the edge cases
    - for fuzzy input, fake it output
    - Don't test with random data, use clear fixed data
    - try to not access the network and preferably not the file system
    - unit test tests one and only one thing
    - tests should be independent, they should be able to run in any order, in parallel, and should not interefere
    - make sure tests don't share data or state. 
    - java truth library helps with testing collections
    - flakiness can be caused by threads
        - be wary of system skew
        - be wary of floating point or rounding errors
        - integer width
        - default character state
    - as soon as you find a bug, write a failing test for it
    - break code deliberately before refactoring it
